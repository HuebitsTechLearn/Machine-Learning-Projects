# ðŸ“° Fake News Detection using NLP

In the era of misinformation, this project lets you build a Machine Learning-based Fake News Detector using NLP. Itâ€™s built with Python, Flask, and Scikit-learn.

## Features

- Detects fake vs real news from input text
- Logistic Regression model trained on TF-IDF vectors
- Clean and vectorized using NLTK and Scikit-learn
- Web app powered by Flask

## Skills Learned

- NLP preprocessing
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Binary classification
- Model deployment via Flask

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Flask
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK (or custom tokenizer)

## How it Works

1. Load and preprocess dataset
2. Vectorize text using TF-IDF
3. Train logistic regression model
4. Build a Flask app for user input
5. Display predictions in the UI

## How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train.py
python app.py
Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to test the app.
